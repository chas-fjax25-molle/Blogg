            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Malmö Group 3 is a group of students studying a Frontend Development course,
                focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are learning how to build modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites
                through teamwork and hands-on projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to improve our technical skills, collaborate effectively, and
                grow as future frontend developers.

                **About Us**

                We are Mölle, also known as Malmö Group 3 – a group of six people who like building things together 
                and seeing where it takes us. The team consists of Vera, Millaray, Tilda, Mario, Pontus, and Oliver, 
                and this blog is our shared playground.

                What started as a simple blog project has slowly grown into something bigger. 
                Each week, we add new ideas, features, and experiments, moving from a front-end–focused 
                build toward a more complete web page with back-end functionality. There’s no strict 
                theme here – this space is about trying things out, learning by doing, and improving as we go.

                Coding and teamwork are at the core of everything we do. We enjoy solving problems together, 
                breaking things (on purpose or not), fixing them again, and learning from the process. 
                Collaboration, inclusivity, and curiosity guide how we work, and everyone in the group 
                contributes their own perspective and skills.

                This blog reflects our journey: a work in progress, shaped by creativity, trial and error, 
                and a shared ambition to build something that’s both fun and functional – with just enough 
                structure to keep things moving forward.
